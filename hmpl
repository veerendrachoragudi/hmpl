Sure! Here is a simple example of a "Hello, World!" program written in a hypothetical minimal programming language (HMPL):

```hmpl
# Print "Hello, World!" to the console
PRINT "Hello, World!"
```

In this example:
- `PRINT` is a command in HMPL to output text to the console.
- `"Hello, World!"` is the string that will be printed.

This basic example demonstrates how you might use HMPL to display a message. If you have more specific requirements or additional functionality you'd like to see in HMPL, please let me know!
